The demographics of the people in the data set are males and females between the age of 18 and 34. The data colelcted incliude their height, weight, BMI, Blood Group, and Heartrate

## Tasks
### For Task 1
We were required use the Medical Students Dataset, Create Pivot Tables displaying the following:
* Average values for the following for Male and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)
* Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places)
* Number of students across the different Blood Groups
* Number of Students who smoke and those who don’t
* Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t

Below are screenshots of the results for task 1

Using the Pivot Tables in Excel, I was able to summarize the data set and derive the average values for all Male and Females with respect to their Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol. On the row, we have the Male and Female metadata and on the columns we have the values themselves. I also used the inbuilt calculation features of Excel to derive the average values.
